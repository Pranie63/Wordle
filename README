*Program Description / Instructions*
    This program is an implementation of the popular New York Times Game, Wordle.
        (it follows the exact same rules as Wordle -> 6 guesses, each 5 letter word.)

    To play, please run the WordleApplication class (NOT the Controller.)

    You do not need to use your cursor to select any boxes, simply start typing and the program will know which tile
    you are typing into.

    After you win or lose, buttons towards the bottom of the window will appear, asking you if you'd like to play again or quit.
        "Play Again" will restart the program anew, and "Quit" will kill the program.

    If you enter an invalid word (invalid meaning it does not exist in the Wordle dictionary, or a bad character such as "!" or a number,)
        then the guess will not be counted against you, and you can try another word with no penalty.

    If you lose, the program will display text at the bottom letting you know what the correct word was.

    Happy playing!
